The directory "Benchmarks" consists of all the benchmark files
The directory "Scripts" has most of the scripts that were employed in testing and required for reproducibility. In particular, we have added 
"discretization.py" script that takes in the non-binarized matrix of features and categories and discretizes the matrices. 
The directory "TrainingDataBehavior" has plots for other benchmarks
similar to Figure 1 


The file "MLIC-data" contains mean of cross validation errors and
time taken by MLIC for various parameters (CNF/DNF rules, k \in {1,2,3} and \lambda in {1,5,10})
